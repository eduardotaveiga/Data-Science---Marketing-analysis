# Data-Science---Marketing-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning for a marketing dataset.

This project is part of my data science learning journey. Feel free to send me a message regarding tips of any kind, like statistics, machine learning, visualizations, or even english grammar, I will be grateful. I hope that you find something useful here and learn with me too!

**What you will see in these notebooks:**  
**Initial data preprocessing:** missing values, typo fixing, categorical to numeric encoding.  
**Exploratory Data Analysis:** correlation matrix, data visualization with plotly.  
**Clusterization:** customer segmentation with KMeans and PCA, analysis and interpretation of each cluster.  
**Machine Learning evaluation:** false positives and false negatives, precion-recall, AUC.  
**Feature selection:** correlation, SelectKBest with chi2, Recursive Feature Extraction with linear model and tree based model.  
**Model benchmark:** train-test-split in unbalanced dataset, cross-validation with stratified KFold, scaling with StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler.    
**Hyperparameter tuning:** optuna, basic explanation of models and parameters, Underfitting.  
**Model selection:** precision-recall curve, threshold selection based on expected value structure.  
**Model predictions:** understanding model predictions with shap.  
 
Below is provided a fictional background case study, more about it on the notebooks.

Company XYZ (fictional) is hiring you as a data scientist in order to get practical data-driven solutions and analysis. They present you a dataset that contains data about customer behaviours, demographics and past campaigns acceptance.

It's up to you to report what is the best approach the company should have based on your findings.

Note: The dataset is not mine. I got it from this repository: https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test
