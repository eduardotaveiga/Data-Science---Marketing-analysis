# Data-Science---Marketing-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning for a marketing dataset.

This project is part of my data science learning journey. Feel free to send me a message regarding tips of any kind, like statistics, machine learning, visualizations, or even english grammar, I will be grateful. I hope that you find something useful here and learn with me too!

Below is provided a fictional background case study, more about it on the notebooks.

Company XYZ (fictional) is hiring you as a data scientist in order to get practical data-driven solutions and analysis. They present you a dataset that contains data about customer behaviours, demographics and past campaigns acceptance.

It's up to you to report what is the best approach the company should have based on your findings.

Note: The dataset is not mine. I got it from this repository: https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test
